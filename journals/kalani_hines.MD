## I worked on

So much stuff. and forgot all about the journal. built back end endpoints, built some Postgres, figured out a lot about FastAPI and routing. Cool. All is in my git history. Did a few MR's and created and finished a lot of issues.

### Today I worked on

Two end-points in users to update the status: verification. With these end-points created we can change the status from the default 'False', to verified as 'True'. I created the secondary redundancy to be able to change it back to 'False' in case of user error or a needed change s that we can change it back to be reverified
**Aha**
After a week off I knocked the dust off a little and had a few 'Ohhhh, riiiight..' moments

### Today I worked on

A more complicated front end end point. I needed to do a lot more with tailwind and had to figure out how to render a specific form for creating a new sock with dropdowns for all of the options. Got most of it running but its not finished. I have a few more elements to work on then I will need to submit the form. Its pretty cool.
**Aha**
I mean, stuff. I figured stuff out but no major crazy revelations

pytest took all day but got it running. Had set backs as I pulled into main to update with the MR's and had issues, then did it again and the data was changed. Took practice test in the am. Need to work on SQL. Trashed the create sock branch and started over at the end of the day. That was my day
**Aha**
Make tests when nobody else is changing the DB! Hahaha
